# 3D Life (RGB + Anti-Desaturation) ‚Äî with UI & High-Res Final

![CI](https://github.com/ramipinku/life3d-rgb/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)

Conway-inspired cellular automaton in **3D** (26-neighbor / Moore) with advanced color inheritance modes to prevent grayscale drift. Each cell has:
- `alive` (1/0)
- `RGB` (0..255) assigned **only on birth** using configurable inheritance modes
- `age` tracking for optional render-time coloring

Key Features:
- **Anti-desaturation**: Multiple color inheritance modes prevent gray drift over long runs
- **Parallel** updates with **toroidal** wrap edges (via `np.roll`)
- Default rule: **B6/S5-7** (configurable)
- **Enhanced mutations**: Per-birth and per-step mutation options
- **Age coloring**: Optional age-based visual enhancement
- **Auto-stop safety**: Extinction and steady-state detection
- **Advanced UI**: Integer-only inputs, color swatches, verbose help text
- **Camera rotation**: Dynamic GIFs with configurable rotation
- **Preset system**: Quick presets for snowflakes, spheres, fractals, and more

## Quick start

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python ui.py
```

## User Interface Features

### Advanced Controls
- **Integer-only inputs**: Grid size and steps accept any integer value (no artificial limits)
- **Color swatches**: Seed list shows visual color previews for each seed
- **Verbose help text**: Every control includes examples and detailed explanations
- **Preset system**: Quick-start configurations for common patterns

### Quick Presets
The UI includes predefined configurations for interesting structures:
- **Snowflake Fractals**: Symmetric patterns with high-contrast colors and rotation
- **Squares**: Geometric structures with sharp color boundaries
- **Spheres**: Central cluster forming spherical growth patterns  
- **Rainbow Arcs**: Arc-shaped seeds with high mutation and vibrant colors
- **Crystal Bloom**: Radial burst patterns with enhanced mutation rates
- **Checkerboard Chaos**: Dense alternating patterns with rapid oscillations

Each preset automatically configures birth/survival rules, grid size, seeds, color modes, mutation rates, and rotation settings. Users can still modify any values after selecting a preset.

### Output Features
- **Animated GIF**: Built from rendered step frames with configurable FPS (1-30)
- **Frame management**: Choose to keep or delete PNG frames after GIF creation
- **Camera rotation**: Optional dynamic rotation during GIF creation (degrees per step)
- **High-resolution final**: Configurable DPI and dimensions for print quality

## Color Inheritance Modes

The system offers five color inheritance modes to control how newborn cells acquire their colors. This is crucial for preventing grayscale drift over long simulations.

### Available Modes

**`Mean RGB` (Original)**
- Simple arithmetic average of all neighbors within radius 2
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Causes gradual drift toward gray over many generations
- Use only for short simulations or when gray drift is acceptable

**`Distance-weighted average`**
- Weights neighbors by `w = 1 / (1 + distance)` where distance is Chebyshev distance
- üìç Closer neighbors have more influence on newborn color
- Reduces gray drift compared to simple mean

**`Two-parent blend` (Genetic-Style)**
- Picks 2 random living neighbors and averages their colors
- üß¨ Simulates genetic inheritance with two parents
- Creates interesting color patterns with moderate diversity

**`Random parent` (Sharp Inheritance)**
- Copies exact RGB from one random living neighbor
- ‚úÖ Maintains sharp color boundaries and prevents blending
- Best for preserving distinct color lineages

**`HSV-boosted mean` (Recommended)**
- Converts to HSV, computes circular mean for hue, boosts saturation
- **Saturation boost**: Multiplies mean saturation (default 1.3)
- **Saturation floor**: Minimum saturation level (default 0.35)
- ‚úÖ **Best anti-desaturation performance** - maintains vivid colors over 1000+ steps

### Recommended Settings

For **vivid long-term simulations**:
```
Color mode: hsv_boosted_mean
Saturation boost: 1.3
Saturation floor: 0.35
Per-birth mutations: 0.15 probability
```

For **sharp color boundaries**:
```
Color mode: random_parent
Per-birth mutations: 0.10 probability
```

For **genetic-like inheritance**:
```
Color mode: two_parent_blend
Per-birth mutations: 0.20 probability
```

## Mutation Systems

### Per-Birth Mutations (Recommended)
- Each newborn cell independently mutates with given probability
- Preserves color diversity without overwhelming noise
- Default: 15% probability, 30.0 standard deviation

### Per-Step Mutations (Legacy)
- At most N cells mutate per simulation step globally
- Includes "burstiness" intervals for realistic mutation patterns  
- Default: 20% probability, max 1 mutant per step

### Combined Approach
Enable both systems for maximum diversity:
- Per-birth: 0.15 probability (sustains diversity)
- Per-step: 0.10 probability (adds occasional large changes)

## Input Rules and Usage

### Grid Size and Steps
- **No artificial limits**: Enter any integer values for grid dimensions and steps
- **Examples**: 8√ó8√ó8 (fast testing), 32√ó32√ó32 (detailed patterns), 64√ó64√ó64 (high detail, slower)
- **Auto-stop safety**: Prevents infinite runs via extinction and steady-state detection

### Rules Format
- **Birth**: Comma-separated neighbor counts for cell birth (e.g., "6" or "5,6,7")
- **Survive**: Comma-separated neighbor counts for cell survival (e.g., "5,6,7")
- **Examples**: B6/S5-7 (balanced), B4-5/S3-5 (geometric), B5-8/S4-8 (explosive)

### Camera Rotation
- **Enable**: Checkbox to activate camera rotation during GIF creation
- **Degrees per step**: How much to rotate camera between frames (2-3¬∞ recommended)
- **Elevation**: Fixed vertical viewing angle (20¬∞ default)
- **GIF only**: Rotation only applies when creating animated GIFs, not final-only renders

## Age Coloring

Optional render-time enhancement that blends cell age with RGB colors:
- Does **not** affect simulation logic - purely visual
- Reveals structure and flow patterns
- Configurable colormap (inferno, plasma, viridis, etc.)
- Adjustable blend factor (0.0 = pure RGB, 1.0 = pure age)

## Development & Testing

The project separates runtime and development dependencies:

- **`requirements.txt`**: Runtime dependencies (numpy, matplotlib, imageio)
- **`requirements-dev.txt`**: Testing and development tools (pytest, coverage, linting)

### Setup for Development

```bash
# Install runtime dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install development dependencies
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
```

### Running Tests

The project includes a comprehensive test suite that validates the core 3D Life logic:

```bash
# Run all tests (quiet mode)
pytest -q

# Run with verbose output
pytest -v

# Run specific test files
pytest tests/test_neighbors.py
pytest tests/test_birth_color.py
pytest tests/test_mutation.py
pytest tests/test_color_modes.py
pytest tests/test_visualize.py

# Run tests with coverage
pytest --cov=life3d --cov=visualize
```

### Test Coverage

- **Neighbor rules**: Birth/death based on 26-neighbor counts
- **Color inheritance**: All 5 color modes including anti-desaturation testing
- **Mutation logic**: Both per-birth and per-step mutations with bounds checking
- **Age tracking**: Cell age progression and newborn age reset
- **Determinism**: Fixed random seeds produce identical results
- **Visualization**: PNG rendering with Agg backend, age coloring support
- **UI components**: Tkinter import, App/SeedManager creation, variable initialization

### Development Guidelines

**Always run tests after making changes:**
```bash
pytest -q
```

The `.gitignore` file excludes pytest cache and coverage files. All tests should pass before committing changes.

## Troubleshooting

### macOS: "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named '_tkinter'"

If you're using Homebrew Python and get a tkinter error when running `python ui.py`:

**Solution 1 (Recommended)**: Install tkinter via Homebrew
```bash
brew install python-tk
```

**Solution 2**: Use system Python (which includes tkinter)
```bash
/usr/bin/python3 ui.py
```

**Solution 3**: Create virtual environment with system Python
```bash
/usr/bin/python3 -m venv venv-system
source venv-system/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python ui.py
```

### Linux: Missing tkinter

On Ubuntu/Debian:
```bash
sudo apt-get install python3-tk
```

On RHEL/CentOS/Fedora:
```bash
sudo dnf install tkinter
# or: sudo yum install tkinter
```

## Continuous Integration

Tests run automatically on GitHub Actions for every push and pull request:

- **OS**: Ubuntu Latest
- **Python versions**: 3.10, 3.11, 3.12
- **Test suite**: All 26 tests with coverage reporting
- **Headless**: Uses matplotlib Agg backend (no GUI required)

The CI workflow installs both runtime and development dependencies, ensures headless operation, and runs the complete test suite with coverage. Build status is shown in the badge above.
